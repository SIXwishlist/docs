The WHSuite admin area (aka 'backend') is where you manage your day to day business operations. From here you can control everything from product pricing, to server deployment priority, to client contact details.

In this article we'll cover the basics of what you can expect to find in the admin area, and how to take advantage of some of it's features.

##Login
You can log into your admin area either at http://yoursite.com/admin or if you've followed our [recommended additional security](../Getting_Started/Post-Installation_Security) steps, browse to the custom directory name you gave your admin area.

The login form requires your registered email address and password. As a built in security feature, all login attempts that fail are 'throttled'. This means a log is created recording that the users IP address attempted to access an account, and failed. 

After five failed attempts, the user is temporaily blocked from any more login attempts for a period of 15 minutes.

##Password Recovery
The admin area login form provides the option to go through to a password reset page. From there you can enter your account email address. An email will then be sent to the account on file (if one exists), providing a unique link to confirm your request. After this a new password will be emailed to you.

##The Dashboard and Widgets
Once you log in for the first time you'll be presented with your system dashboard. As standard this will likely be empty. The dashboard features a 'widget' system, allowing you to customise the information, and layout of your personal dashboard. 

To set up your widgets, you can click your name in the top right corner of the admin area, and a drop-down list will be presented. Next, click the 'Profile' link to edit your personal settings.

From here you can set up both your shortcuts (Which are icon-based links to major areas of the system, located at the top of your Dashboard) and your widgets.

To activate widgets on your dashboard, drag them from the left 'Available Widgets' list over to the 'Selected Widgets' list. You can then reorder the display of them. The same re-order options also work for shortcuts.

Once you've enabled your widgets and shortcuts, press the save button and return to your Dashboard. You should now see all of your widgets and shortcuts.

Some addons will also install additional widgets and/or shortcuts. The official WHSuite Support Desk and Knowledgebase addons provide their own optional widgets.

##Sidebar
The sidebar of the admin are is managed by the Menu Management area, and can be customised globally. As standard we've sorted each major area into sub-menus. 

When viewing the admin area on a small screen device such as mobiles, the side bar will automatically hide, and a button to show it will be provided in the top left corner. 

##Top Bar
The top bar shows the current page name on the left side. On the right side it shows your user name, with a drop-down menu to access your profile and to log out.

When you have one or more pending order, an additional icon is shown in the top right displaying the number of pending orders. When this is clicked, a drop-down list of these orders is shown.

##Multilingual Interface
The entire WHSuite system uses translation tables to store words and phrases in each supported language. We ship WHSuite with English as the standard language, however additional language packs are available on our [community translations website](https://translations.whsuite.com)

If you've already added a new language pack into WHSuite, you can set both your user/personal language as well as the system-wide language. This is covered in the system settings section of the documentation.

Email templates can also be translated into languages that have been installed on your site by goind to the Email Template Management area of your admin area.
