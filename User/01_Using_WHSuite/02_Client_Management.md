Managing clients from your WHSuite admin area couldn't be easier. To access the client management area, log into your admin area account and click the 'Client Management' menu option. You'll be presented with a list of the latest clients. 

On the side of the page is the option to filter results. From this section you can enter client specific details to search through clients until you find the client you'd like to manage.

When you click 'Manage' next to a client's details, you'll be taken to the Client Profile section.

##Client Profile
The client profile section is split into several tabs, with links on the side to help you navigate these areas.

###Overview
The client overview provides you with the basic details about your client, such as their name, contact details and statistics about their account. You can also view their account credit balances, which are shown per-currency.

###Services
The client services section lists all current and past services that you provided the client. As standard this screen will list the first 15 services, however if you'd like to view more, you can click the 'All Services' button at the bottom of the page.

Clicking 'Manage' next to any client service will take you to the Service Management page.

###Invoices
The client invoices section lists the latest 15 invoices that relate to the client. Invoices are listed by date and show basic details such as the total due, the payment status and the date due.

Clicking 'Manage' next to an invoice will take you to a full view of the invoice, where you can edit invoice items and pricing, apply payments and view any transactions applied to the invoice.

###Transactions
The client transactions section lists the latest 15 transactions made by or for this client. Transaction records are created every time a payment is made to you by the client, as well as every time a staff member issues a credit or debit note against the client.

This means that you can keep track of every transaction that takes place, allowing for greater control over your company accounting. 

Each transaction record shows the amount received or spent, the gateway used (if applicable) and a description. The description field will usually show either a staff note if the transaction record was manually added, or a note provided by the payment gateway. For example some automated transactions that come from Authorize.net will show the Authorize.net transaction number, allowing staff to then log into your companies authorize.net account to look up the transaction record with ease.

###CC/ACH Accounts
The CC/ACH Accounts section lists all the credit/debit cards and/or Automated Clearing House bank account details that the client has stored. Staff can also add CC/ACH details themselves, allowing for remote orders to be taken.

A default credit/debit card and default ACH account can be set, and this is displayed on the list. The default card/account will be used for any automated payments applied to the customer.

###Emails
The client emails section is a log of all emails sent to the client. WHSuite keeps a record of every email it sends to clients. This means you can verify that a client has, for example recieved notice of a late payment before suspending their service.

Each stored email can be viewed from this section. At the bottom of the page is the option to view all stored emails, as well as to compose a custom email to the client.

For maximum client security, the only emails that are not logged in WHSuite are ones that contain passwords when a password reset request is sent. Staff should never need to see these.

###Profile
The client profile section provides the option to edit the client's contact details and basic account settings. Since WHSuite supports custom fields, any custom client profile fields will also be shown here.

###Notes
The client notes section lets you view all staff-created notes about the client. You can also add new notes. Notes are simple text boxes that can be used to store any custom information about clients that is only visible to staff. 


##Shortcuts
The shortcuts section provides links to some common client management options:

**Login as client** allows you to temporarily log in to the client area as this client.

**Email New Password** will send a new password to the email address on file for this client.

**Send Email** takes you to a compose email page, where you can write a custom email to the client.

**Add Funds** allows you to add credit to the clients account manually. It takes you to the New Transaction screen which is used for both adding funds and adding a debit note.
