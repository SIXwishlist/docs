Built into WHSuite `AppController` is scaffolding ability, this allows you to construct a whole CRUD admin section for a module by only defining a few methods.

While developing an addon and using the scaffolding you can use as little or as much of it as needed. The beauty of it means this can be easily done by just overriding the methods you need. 

Use the sub menu to the left to view the docs for the listing and the form scaffolding sections.
