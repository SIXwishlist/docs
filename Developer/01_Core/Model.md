The core Model class simply extends Laravels Eloquent base model. This is done to provide an easier to use Model for extending (with eloquent the full namespace would need to be included everytime).

For full documentation on the WHSuite model system, please see the [Eloquent Documentation](http://laravel.com/docs/eloquent) for all the base functionality.  
For more custom functionality please see the [App Model Documentation](/Developer/App/Model) to view all the custom methods we've added to make models easier to use.
